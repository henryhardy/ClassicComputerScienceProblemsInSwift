**Classic Computer Science Problems in Swift: Essential Techniques for Practicing Programmer**

I studied EE and never had to do a lot of the CS homework style 'classic' psets. Turns out that **_classic_** is basic compression, and playing with the fibonacci sequence a lot, but thought it might be fun to work through, especially as ideas for practice questions to ask potential candidates in interviews, as well as for my own interview prep.

Because knowing how to do roll your own compression on a white board on in a playgroudn is crucially important ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯

At Expedia I have used a pokemon battle simulator challenge where I give a candidate 2 pokemon with various stats and ask them to simulate a battle, but try to have a few back up questions in case the candidate doesn't get as excited by pokemon as I do.

I'll try to do one Playground per chapter.

I also don't expect these example to make too much sense out of the context of the book - I think generally it's worth buying, as initially I was just straight reading the booking, but it became a little difficult to follow along with around chapter 7 if you're not actually writing out the functions (I wish books had syntax highlighting without the additional cost of coloured printing.)
